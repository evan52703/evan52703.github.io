<p2>On May 27th, 2003, my parents <b>Madelyne Trejo</b> and <b>Hector Trejo</b> had me. It's since been 19 (almost 20) years and I've grown around a loving and caring family.</p2>

<h3 id="fam">Family</h3>
<p3> My family consists of 8 total current members:
<ol>
  <li>Me, Evan!</li>
  <li>My mother: Madelyn Trejo</li>
  <li>My father: Hector Trejo</li>
  <li>My brother: Ethan Trejo</li>
  <li>My sister: Ellesyn Trejo</li>
  <li>Dog 1: Cash</li>
  <li>Dog 2: Connor</li>
  <li>Dog 3: Cooper!</li>
<br>
Fun Fact! Both my siblings and I as well as my dogs all start with the same letter! E's for us and C's for them.

Hey! You want to see if your name is <i>cool</i> enough to be even considered remotely <i>cool</i> to my family? Test this python code below to find out! The program will determine your name's <i>coolness</i>.

What are your favorite hobbies? Just kidding there's no way you could tell me. But sharing those hobbies with family is what brings us together! Consider sharing an activity with a family memeber the next time they're around.

<h3 id=height>Height</h3>
<p3>
<br>
Our last and <b>most important</b> section is about the height in our family. It's all over the place. If you have a family you know what I mean.
<br>
The smallest member at 8th goes to Cash.
<br>
This chubby dog is weighed down by the fat he's accumulated over the years.
<br>
He is healthy but still, probably shorter than his dog brother.
<br>
I'd say he's like 1'9 standing on 2 legs.

<br>
<br>
<br>
At 7th place is Cash's brother: Connor.
<br>
This dude is barely taller than his brother.
<br>
He's a very anxious dog naturally, but his height isn't hindered.
<br>
I'd say he's like 2'0 standing on 2 legs.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, at 6th, is Cooper.
<br>
This big guy isn't at all related to Cash or Connor and they fight all the time.
<br>
Sometimes they get along though.
<br>
I'd say Coop is like 3'8 standing his hind legs.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Our first human at 5th is Elly.
<br>
She's the youngest of us all so naturally she's gonna be small
<br>
Sadly, she's almost as tall as my dad.
<br>
Elly's like 5'2.

<br>
<br>
<br>
Next, at 4th, is my Dad.
<br>
This dude is a short king.
<br>
And my dad.
<br>
He's like 5'4

<br>
<br>
<br>
At thrid is my brother, Ethan.
<br>
He's a gamer so his posture is not the best.
<br>
Doesn't have a valid excuse to be mad about height.
<br>
He's like 5'6.

<br>
<br>
<br>
At second is me!
<br>
I was actually taller than my mom for a bit but I feel like I never see her as shorter than me anymore.
<br>
She deserves it though.
<br>
I'm like 5'10.

<br>
<br>
<br>
At first is me mama.
<br>
She's awesome.
<br>
And the tallest.
<br>
She's like 6'0!
</p3>

<br>
<br>
<br>

<h2 id=end> Finale</h2>
<p3>
<br>
And that's all about me! Hopefully you learned a thing or two cause I have 0 things left to share.
<br>
That is seriously all.
<br>

<br>
<br>
There's nothing else to see.
